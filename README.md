### Quick EDA (Week 1)
- Dataset: `tips` (restaurant tips) â€” used for EDA practice.
- What I did in first hour:
  - Loaded dataset, checked shape, missing values.
  - Produced distribution histogram of `total_bill`.
  - Calculated average `tip` by `day`.
- Next steps: feature engineering, model baseline, Power BI dashboard.
